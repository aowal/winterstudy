# winterstudy
Winter Study of Computer Vision Lab at Seoul National University. 

Organizer: Myungsub Choi, Jiwon Kim

Members: Jiwon Kim, Myungsub Choi, Jung Kwon Lee (Let Jiwon know if interested to join)

# Plan 
## Conference track

1. ICCV 2015 reading
2. NIPS 2015 reading
3. ICLR 2016 (submission) reading
4. CVPR 2016 (submission) reading 
5. arXiv misc. 


## ML Study
TODO. What learning methods other than the standard supervised learning we need to know? Also, we need to collect the most recent ones such as universum, net2net, weakly supervised learning (vedaldi) and much more.


## Lectures

1. Deep Learning Summer School Videos
2. CS231n, CS224d
3. David Silver RL lectures
4. Oxford Machine Learning Course


## Code Practice

### Framework Study
1. Tensorflow
2. Torch
3. Theano
4. Programming practice - making examples (cf. simple cnn/rnn examples, spatial transformer, etc.)

### Paper Implementation

TODO. What papers to implement?

### Code Survey (Collect Training Examples)

Collect open sources done with decent network training skills
